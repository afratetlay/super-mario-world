## UX

### Project Goals

I wanted to learn more about APIs and how I can integrate them into a project and thought this would be a fun project to do whilst learning about APIs. 


### Design Choices

This is quite a simple looking project, with the main aim of having included API:

**Colours**

- As this was based off Super Mario, I chose colours which goes with that theme.

**Styling**

- I have made sure the styling of the map is appealing to the eye by the various colours.
